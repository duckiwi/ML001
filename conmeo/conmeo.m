%% sample program for machine learning demo
% the program will use data from coursera assignments
% the program includes:
% 

%       import data, extract information
%       plot data for visualization
%       linear regression with regulization
%       logistic regression with regulization
%       neural network with regulization, along with debug tools
%       plot result for visualization
%       cross validation and testing
%       analyze the role of regulization
%       analyze the size of training set by prediction accuracy/error and plot training curve
